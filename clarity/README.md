A simple Übersicht widget status bar via yabai support. This status bar is designed to clearly show important details for virtual desktop management within a minimal amount of space, putting focus onto the task you’re doing. Plus, it’s updated to complement modern macOS design.

Note that as a result of this being primarily for personal use, the design and implementation of this status bar may have changes over time.
