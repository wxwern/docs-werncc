# Calendar View

?> The Calendar View is currently only available in [**Personal Diary beta**](/personal-diary/beta-releases.md), and its behaviour is subject to change.

Tapping the **Calendar View Toggle** (at the bottom left of the Timeline) results in the app cycling between these view modes:

- None
- **Month Calendar View**
- **Week Calendar View**
- **Month Text View**

The number of dots under a date indicates the number of entries on that day, or a line if there is more than 3 entries.

Tapping an entry in the calendar scrolls the Timeline to the corresponding entry.
