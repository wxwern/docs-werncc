# Daily Reminders

You can get daily reminders by turning it on under **Reminder Notifications** in the app settings.

After turning it on, you'd be notified to write in the app on your set time. You will not receive a reminder if you've not written in the **last open journal** in the last 12 hours.

?> **Note:** Reminder notifications are not synced. Thus, you might want to only enable reminders on one device.
