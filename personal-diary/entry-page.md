# Entry Page

When you create or view an entry, you'll be greeted with the **Entry Page**. An entry page fully filled with contents may look like the following:

The Entry Page is where you can browse and edit your entries. On wider screens, the Entry Page is shown on the right side of the split view.

## Entry Page Elements

The entry page consists of the following elements:

![Entry Page Annotated Screenshot](_media/entry-page-annotated.png ':size=300')

### 1. Entry Text

This center space contains your entry text.

- **Click or tap the center space** to edit. On a keyboard, you can press <kbd aria-label="Command">&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

- **Bold**, *Italics*, <u>Underline</u>, ~~Strikethrough~~, and [Hyperlink]() formatting is supported.

### 2. Entry Attachments

The bottom row consists of a horizontal list of image attachments.

- **Tap the `+` button** located at the right of the list to attach an item.

- Tip: You can also drag and drop attachments on this row to attach them in the entry.

- _**NOTE:** Only images are supported at the moment._

### 3. Entry Metadata

Supplementary metadata about your entry is located around the page. This includes the date, time, mood, weather, tags, entry format, word count, and the journal it's stored in.

**Click or tap** any metadata to bring up the metadata editor.

Some metadata options (like mood and weather) are automatically chosen by default. You can change or remove them as needed, or change the default options in **Personal Diary Settings** &rarr; **New Entry Defaults**.

### 4. Extra Actions

On the top bar, we have buttons for additional actions. They are:

- **Refresh**: Reload the entry.
- **Export**: Export the currently displayed entry.
- **Edit**: Edit the entry's text, metadata, or create another new entry.

## Saving Entries

You don't have to worry about saving your entries. The app **automatically saves** your entry as soon as you pause typing briefly.

?> **Hint:** For peace of mind, you can easily observe when autosave was successful. If your changes aren't yet saved, you will either see an asterisk (`*`) next to the entry format and word counter, or an error message warning you that saving has failed.

## Flipping Pages

The Entry Page emulates a "book", where you can flip through pages to read other entries in chronological order by:

- **swiping left or right** on the Entry Page, or

- **scrolling left or right** using a mouse or trackpad, or

- **pressing <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd> or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd>** on a keyboard.

?> For an immersive reading experience, you can also consider turning on **Personal Diary Settings** &rarr; **Behaviour** &rarr; **Use Page Curl Animations** under Entry Page View, which emulates a real page flip on a physical book.

?> The order the pages are in can be customized in **Personal Diary Settings** &rarr; **Behaviour** &rarr; **Sort Latest Entry on Leftmost Page** under Entry Page View.
