# Export and Import

You can export and import all of your current journal's data as backups, to transfer them, obtain a physical copy, or for any other purpose. After all, you should have full control of your data.

## Exporting

### Export Single Entry

You can export singular entries as a **PDF Document** by tapping the share button on the **Entry Page**.

### Export Multiple Entries

Navigate to **Export or Print Data** in the **app's settings**.

There are two file formats for bulk exports:

- **PDF Document** (easy to open and read, also automatically used for **printing**)
- **Raw Data Archive (.zip)** (includes a complete copy of all data, can be re-imported)

Additional options for exporting, like selecting a date range, can be found within the export page.

?> **Note:** You cannot select a date range and export data until all entries in the Journal you want to export are loaded. The load progress can be seen in the Timeline.

!> **Warning:** If you store your data on iCloud Drive, ensure all your data has been downloaded before exporting to avoid missing or inaccurate data in your export.

## Importing

You can only import **Raw Data Archive (.zip)** files exported by the app.

Navigate to **Export or Print Data** in the **app's settings** and choose a .zip file to import. This will be imported as a separate journal and automatically enables [Multi-Journal Mode](/personal-diary/multiple-journals). You can then merge it into an existing journal if you so choose.

?> **Note:** Third-party exports, even if they are `.zip` files, cannot be imported unless converted in some way. The requirements for the **Raw Data Archive `.zip` file** that Personal Diary accepts to be imported is specified [here](/personal-diary/export-data-format).
