# Multiple Journals

Need to have separate journals for different categories, like splitting Personal and Work Journals in separate "books"? Turn on **Multi-Journal Mode** in the app's settings!

When you have Multi-Journal Mode turned on for the first time, the starting page when you first open the app is no longer the Timeline. Rather, you will be greeted with the **Journal Picker**.

## Journal Picker

You can **create a new journal** in your current [Storage Location](/personal-diary/storage-management) by tapping the `+` button, or **manage existing journals** by tapping-and-holding or control-clicking them.

The Journal Picker will be shown when you first open the app after quitting it.

However, you can also configure the app to:

- **Keep the last journal open when quitting the app**, or
  - This can be configured under Multi-Journal Mode settings.

- **Select a preferred journal to automatically open** the first time the Journal Picker shows up.
  - Tap and hold or control-click a journal, then tap "Set as Preferred".

## Moving Entries

You might occasionally need to move or transfer entries between journals. In these cases, you can simply tap-and-hold or control-click (secondary click) an entry within the Timeline to perform these actions.
