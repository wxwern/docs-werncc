# Searching Entries

Personal Diary includes an intelligent search bar that can search a variety of things in a journal, including both entry text and metadata (date, mood, weather, tags). Once all your data in the Timeline is loaded, you can start typing search queries.

## Search Input Format

Depending on what you want to search for, you can type them in the following manner:

| Search Type | Input Example |
|---|---|
| **Keywords** in Entry Text | `john anniversary party` |
| **Exact Phrase** in Entry Text | `"Alice in the Wonderland"` |
| **Date & Time** | `31 Jan 1 PM`, `12-3-23`, `June`, etc. |
| **Tags** | `#yourtaghere` |
| **Mood & Weather** | `ðŸ˜ƒ` |

?> **Hint:** The search bar picks out and searches individual keywords by default, so symbols are automatically ignored in your query, unless they are surrounded with double-quotes (`"`) or have a special meaning like hashtags (`#`). <br /><br /> Thus, to find text with `$100` exactly and not just `100`, you have to type `"$100"`, including the double-quotes.
