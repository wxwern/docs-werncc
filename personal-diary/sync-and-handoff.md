# iCloud Sync

Personal Diary automatically synchronizes all your data across all your Apple devices with iCloud Sync. Thus, you can always view, create and edit your journal, regardless of which device you are using, and it'll be available everywhere!

## Requirements

iCloud sync is enabled by default if you already use an Apple ID for all your devices. Nevertheless, these are the minimal requirements for iCloud Sync to function for Personal Diary:

1. You must be **signed in to the same Apple ID** on all your devices. Your Apple ID is the account listed at the top in System Settings.
2. In _System Settings_ &rarr; \[Your Name\] &rarr; iCloud &rarr; Apps Using iCloud, **iCloud Drive is enabled** and **Personal Diary is turned on**.
4. In _Personal Diary_ &rarr; Settings &rarr; Storage Location &amp; Usage, **iCloud Drive is selected as the storage location**.

?> **Note:** If you have been storing data in Local Storage for a while and need to switch to iCloud Drive, you might need to [migrate data between storage locations](/personal-diary/storage-management?id=migrating-data-between-storage-locations).

Furthermore, for sync to happen as soon as possible, you must:
1. be **connected to the Internet**,
2. have **not blocked Internet access** for <u>both</u> Personal Diary and iCloud Drive (such as in Cellular Data settings),
3. have **Low Data Mode is turned off**,
4. have **Low Power Mode is turned off**,
5. have **adequate space available** in <u>both</u> iCloud and your local storage.

Once that's done, the app will sync data to iCloud Drive on a best effort basis. If the app does not update new data immediately, in which case a simple refresh of the Timeline in both the origin device and target device would suffice to request the app to immediately update data.

?> **Hint:** You can refresh the Timeline by performing a "pull down to refresh", pressing <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> on a keyboard, or selecting Refresh in the triple-dot menu.
