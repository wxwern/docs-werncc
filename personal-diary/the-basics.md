# The Basics

Welcome to Personal Diary!

The essence of Personal Diary is creating "entries" in your "journal". This provides a simple way to mimic the concept of writing each day or item on a page in a physical journalling book.

We will introduce you to the two most important places you'll be in the app: the **Timeline** and **Entry Page**.

## Timeline

You first begin in the **Timeline** after opening a journal. It is where all your entries are stored, and when populated, it looks a little something like this:

As seen above, the Timeline displays a list of your entries in **chronological order**.

Some **primary actions** are at the top bar, while you can access a myriad of **quick actions** at the triple-dot menu `•••` at the bottom right.

Note that on wider screens, you may have the Timeline on the left, next to a cover page:

Now, **creating an entry** is easy. Simply press the `+` button at the top right and a new page should pop up.

## Entry Page

Once you create an entry, you'll be greeted with the **Entry Page**. A filled in Entry Page may look like the following:

![Entry Page Mobile Screenshot](_media/entry-page.png ':size=300')

On larger screens, this might be shown on the right of the timeline in a **Timeline-Entry Split View** like so:

![Entry Page Widescreen Screenshot](_media/entry-page-wide.png ':size=800')

Initially, this would be mostly blank.

### Entry Page Interface Elements

Take note of the following elements of the Entry Page:

 1. **Entry Text**

    - This center space contains your entry text.
    - **Click or tap the center space** to edit.
    - **Bold**, *Italics*, <u>Underline</u>, ~~Strikethrough~~, and [Hyperlink]() formatting is supported.

 2. **Entry Attachments**

    - The bottom row here is a horizontal list of image attachments.
    - **Tap the `+` button** located at the right of the list to attach an item.
    - Tip: You can also drag and drop attachments on this row to attach them in the entry.
    - _**NOTE:** Only images are supported at the moment._

 3. **Entry Metadata**

    - Supplementary metadata about your entry is located around the page.
    - Customizable metadata like the date can be **clicked or tapped** to edit.
    - Many metadata options (like mood and weather) are automatically chosen. You can change or remove them as needed.

 4. **Extra Actions**

    - On the top bar, we have buttons for additional actions, like refreshing, exporting and edit options.

## Extra Notes

While editing entry text, the app **automatically saves** as soon as you pause typing briefly, so you can be rest assured that your data is always saved.

Plus, the app **syncs across all your devices** via iCloud Drive. Thus, if you're signed in to the same Apple ID on all your Apple devices, you can create, view and edit them on all devices and Personal Diary will stay up-to-date.

On iOS 13+, iPadOS 13+, macOS 10.15+ and watchOS 6+ (the versions officially still supported by Personal Diary), you can find advanced actions by tapping and holding, Haptic Touch, 3D Touch, or control-clicking the item. For instance, tap and hold an entry in the Timeline to see a preview or delete it.

## Customization

Don't like the defaults? Many customization options are available in the app's settings. For example:

- Prefer to not have mood and weather set in your entries? Turn it off under **New Entry Defaults**.
- Want to emulate the feeling of turning pages in a book? Turn on **Page Curl Animations**.
- Prefer to customize the app colors? Check out **Light & Dark Color Scheme** options under **Themes**.
- Want to have multiple journals (like separate ones for Personal and Work)? You can turn **Multi-Journal Mode** on.
- ...and many more!

Check out the in-app settings (or look at the sidebar menu of this webpage) for more info!
