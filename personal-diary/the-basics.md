# The Basics

Welcome to Personal Diary!

The essence of Personal Diary is creating "entries" in your "journal". This provides a simple way to mimic the concept of writing each day or item on a page in a physical journalling book.

We will introduce you to the two most important places you'll be in the app: the **Timeline** and **Entry Page**.

## Timeline

You first begin in the **Timeline** after opening a journal. It is where all your entries are stored, and when populated, it looks a little something like this:

The Timeline displays a list of your entries in **chronological order**.

Some **primary actions** are at the top bar, while you can access a myriad of **quick actions** at the triple-dot menu `•••` at the bottom right.

For more details, see the [full Timeline documentation](/personal-diary/timeline).

Now, **creating an entry** is easy. Simply press the `+` button at the top right and a new page should pop up.

## Entry Page

Once you create or view an entry, you'll be greeted with the **Entry Page**. A filled in Entry Page may look like the following:

Initially, this would be mostly blank.

### Entry Page Interface Elements

Take note of the following elements of the Entry Page:

 1. **Entry Text**

   This center space contains your entry text. **Click or tap the center space** to edit.

 2. **Entry Attachments**

   The bottom row consists of a horizontal list of image attachments. **Tap the `+` button** located at the right of the list to attach an item (only images are supported at the moment).

 3. **Entry Metadata**

   Supplementary metadata about your entry is located around the page. Customizable metadata like the date can be **clicked or tapped to edit**.

 4. **Extra Actions**

   On the top bar, we have buttons for other extra actions, like refreshing, exporting and edit options.

For more details, see the [full Entry Page documentation](/personal-diary/entry-page).

## Autosave

While editing entry text, the app **automatically saves** as soon as you pause typing briefly, so you can be rest assured that your data is never lost.

## iCloud Sync

The app **syncs across all your devices** via iCloud Drive. That means you can create, view and edit them on all devices and Personal Diary will stay up-to-date. For the exact requirements, see the [full iCloud Sync documentation](/personal-diary/sync-and-handoff).

## Advanced Actions

You can find more advanced options for an item by **tapping and holding, Haptic Touch, 3D Touch, control-clicking or secondary-clicking**. For instance, tap and hold an entry in the Timeline to see a preview or delete it.

?> This requires iOS 13+, iPadOS 13+, macOS 10.15+, or watchOS 6+.

## Customization

Don't like the defaults? Many customization options are available in the app's settings. For example:

- Prefer to not have mood and weather set in your entries? Turn it off under **New Entry Defaults**.
- Want to emulate the feeling of turning pages in a book? Turn on **Page Curl Animations**.
- Prefer to customize the app colors? Check out **Light & Dark Color Scheme** options under **Themes**.
- Want to have multiple journals (like separate ones for Personal and Work)? You can turn **Multi-Journal Mode** on.
- ...and many more!

Check out the in-app settings (or look at the sidebar menu of this webpage) for more info!
