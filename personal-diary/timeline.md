# Timeline View

When you first open your journal, you will be greeted with the **Timeline**. It is where all your entries are stored, and when populated, it looks like this:

The Timeline displays a list of your entries in **chronological order**. If you are using a wider screen, the Timeline may be on the left side of the split view.

From top to bottom, the timeline page consists of a top bar, your list of entries, and finally a bottom toolbar.

## Top Bar

The top bar may display the following:

- **Journal Picker**\* (left): Switch between multiple journals.
- **Lock**\*\* (left): Locks the app.
- **Journal Name**\* (center): The name of the currently open journal.
- **Settings** (right): Access the app settings.
- **Create New Entry** (right): Creates a new entry.


\* Only visible if [Multi-Journal Mode](/personal-diary/multiple-journals.md) is enabled.

\*\* Requires [App Lock](/personal-diary/app-lock.md) to be enabled.


## Entry List

The entry list displays all your entries in **chronological order**. By default, the topmost entry is the latest one.

The [search bar](/personal-diary/searching-entries.md) and [calendar view](/personal-diary/calendar-view.md) may appear above this list.

You can tweak the way the app presents your entry information here by going to **Personal Diary Settings** &rarr; **Behaviour**, and configuring the options available under the "Timeline" section:

- **Show Entry Components...**: Choose which components of each entry are visible in the list.

- **Sort Latest Entry on Top**: Whether to sort the latest entry to the top or bottom of the list.

- **Default to Today's Entry**: Automatically scroll to the entry closest to today when possible. If disabled, the list will always start at the top.

## Bottom Bar

The bottom bar may display the following:

- **Calendar View Toggle** (left): Switch to the [Calendar View](/personal-diary/calendar-view.md).

- **Status** (center): Shows the current status of the app, like the load, search or download progress.

- **Quick Actions** (right): Access more actions, like search, entry order, jumping to days, triggering full downloads, and more. Some actions from the top are duplicated here for quick one-handed access on mobile devices.
