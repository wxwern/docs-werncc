# UI Customization

There are many interface customization options available in Personal Diary Settings.

## Themes

Select from a variety of color schemes to suit your preferences!

- Select the color you prefer.
- Pick between Minimal, Pastel and Vibrant designs.
- Automatically toggle between Light and Dark Color Schemes based on your system settings and brightness.

## Behaviour

### Split View

- You can enable **Timeline-Entry Split View** to show the Timeline and Entry Page side by side if you are using a sufficiently wide screen.

### Timeline

- You can set which elements you prefer to be displayed in entries listed on the Timeline.
- You can toggle the direction of Timeline sort and whether it scrolls to the current day by default.

### Entry Page

- You can toggle the sorting direction of pages when swiping between pages in the Entry Page.
- You can turn on **Focused Editing Mode** to hide the top bar (and side Timeline view on wide screens) when editing an entry.
- You can choose to turn on **Page Curl Animations** if you want to emulate the feeling of flipping through pages of a physical book.

## Date Format

Customize the exact detail you prefer dates in your entries to be displayed in. The available options are:

- Show Day &amp; Month
- Show Day, Month &amp; Time
- Show Day, Month &amp; Day of Week
- Show Day, Month, Day of Week &amp; Time

You can also choose whether you want to **Show Dates in Original Entry Timezone**, if you have written entries in differing timezones in the past.

## Entry Text

Customize the text size for entries and how it's displayed on your screen.

You can also choose how wide your text spans on very large horizontal screens via the **Entry Page Maximum Horizontal Span** section. For instance, if you are using a Mac or iPad with an Ultrawide Display.
